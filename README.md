# Reward_Bases
Code for experiments and figures in "Reward Bases: Instanteous Reward Revaluation with Temporal Difference Learning". Paper can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/04/14/2022.04.14.488361.full.pdf

The ``sea_salt_experiment.py`` file contains the scripts to reproduce the Berridge experiment scripts.

The ``papageorgiou results.py`` script reproduces the panels of Figure 6 in the paper (based on the experiments of Papageorgiou et al)

The ``room_task_experiments.py`` script reproduces the panels of Figure 7 on the room task.

The files ``envs.py`` contains the environment classes for the various experiments and the ``learners.py`` file contains the classes for the reward basis, temporal difference, and successor representation agent
